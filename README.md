##  What This Script Does

This Python script tracks the **Bitcoin/Gold price ratio** (BTC/PAXG) using live data from CoinGecko.

It calculates:
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)** of the RSI

When Bitcoin's momentum shifts — detected by the RSI crossing above or below the SMA — it sends a **Pushbullet alert** recommending a BUY for either Bitcoin or Gold.

Ideal for anyone who holds both assets and wants a simple technical signal on when to switch between them.
